# Project-PR2

A simple program to manage the inventory of a pharmacy.

The program was build in QT5 and use file input/output to:

- Add items to inventory

- See the all the items added sorted by:

  * Name
  * Cost
  * Quantity
  * Active Component
  * Laboratory
  * Expiration date
  
- Verify expiration date of all items from the current date to a certain range of days

PS: The code its not commented, maybe I will comment it and add sells functionality in the future.
